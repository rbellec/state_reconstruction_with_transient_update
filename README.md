State reconstructions considering permanent or transient modifications:
    - Permanent modification of a parameter event.
    - Temporary modification with a time boundary.
    note that time may be any Ord data (sime, event sequence number...) but not nececarily date/time.

The goal is to experiment for multiple subjects and in multiple lang : 
- Conflict Free Replication Data Type, considering interactions between transient & permanent value modifications may not
  fit in my (still very basic) understanding of CmRDTs, I would like to experiment.
- An immediate need : french laws allow temporary and permanent modification of some contracts. I would like
  to rebuild the full states list of intermediate values.
